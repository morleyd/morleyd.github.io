			<h3>Conversational AI Prospectus</h3>
			<time datetime="2021-12-12">Made: December 8, 2018</time>
			<p> I have been excited about conversational machines for a long time. This work is the culmination of three months' research and hopefully the start of much more. I gave particular emphasis to the historical background, shortcomings, and the future of task-oriented systems. Recent approaches are highlighted and serve as a starting point for future research and development. Lastly, I make proposals for future studies to build on the current successes of the field are outlined.</p>

			<h3>Catch Phrase Game</h3>
			<time datetime="2021-05-08">Made: December 8, 2018</time>
			<p>I created a textbased videogame version of the Hasbro party game Catch Phrase! The computer opponent parses natural language clues and uses a word2vec model to guess a given word. Next it provides clues using the BabelNet api. The full code is availiable on <a href="https://github.com/morleyd/catch_phrase">GitHub</a>.</p>

			<h3>Battery Vision</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-12-08">Made: December 8, 2018</time>
			<p>Due to the massive volume of research literature on any given topic, extracting specific data can be work-intensive. As an effort to mitigate this, my team implemented a Word2Vec approach to indexing data in lithium-sulfur battery literature. Word2Vec is an algorithm that converts each word in the training set to a vector and then embedding them in a high dimensional space based on their similarity. This technique allows researchers to use the relative distance between words to ascertain their similarity as well as to infer how they relate to other words. Using this method, we were able to determine which reported values were theoretical or actually observed in experiments. Our results and presentation were ranked most impressive in a class poster presentation. </p>

			<h3>German Speech Recognizer</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-12-10">Made: December 10, 2019</time>
			<p>In many domains, building an automatic speech recognizer has become a rather solved problem. The accuracy and quality that has been attained in English were only achieved after many years of optimization and by using large training sets. While the technology and some open-source data sets exist, few people have made acoustic models or speech recognizers in German. I sought to remedy this situation by using the Kaldi recipes prepared by Cobalt Speech Inc. and the opensource CommonVoice German dataset. Even with a major mistake in the data cleaning steps, we still acheived a word error rate of 33%. This number improved drastically when the model was re-trained with properly cleaned data. In the process of making the final model, I worked with several machine learning algorithms including Hidden Markov Models, Gaussian Mixture Models and Deep Neural Networks as well as other technologies. Due to the nature of my collaboration with Cobalt, they own the rights to the completed model and subsequent code that I made. </p>

			<h3>Amazon S3 DeepRacer</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-11-15">Made: November 15, 2019</time>
			<p>I was invited to compete in an AWS DeepRacer competition. After a fire-hose training on reinforcement learning, we were given the opportunity to use what we had learned to compete. We each coded up a cost function to ‘teach’ the car the best way around the track. Then we used the provided virtual racetrack to train our models. I was handicapped by only having half the time to train my model. However, cost function was among the most adaptable from the virtual training environment to the real-world test racetrack. In the real-world test situation, my car completed the track in 11 seconds placing me third amongst the fifty or so attendees that day.</p>

			<h3>Statistical Forecasting</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-08-16">Made: August 16, 2019</time>
			<p>I developed a model to forecast supply and demand of core services both in the short term and 10 years into the future. Using domain knowledge and SQL, I was able to obtain and clean data sets to find solutions to new problems. Then I worked with a Bayesian Structured Time Series approach in R to predict future quantities. I built dashboards in Tableau to display different aspects of the forecast and built tools to enable users to manipulate parameters. These tools were integral to the budgeting and planning efforts of many departments.</p>

			<h3>Conference Analysis</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-12-20">Made: December 20, 2019</time>
			<p>Over the course of two semesters, myself and two classmates used text archives of the biannual General Conference of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints to draw conclusions about trnds over time. The first semester was mainly devoted to gathering and cleaning the dataset and drawing initial conclusions. I built a webscraper and text-cleaning pipeline as well as analyzed the correlation of the number of missionaries serving from the Church with different conference themes over time. For our full results, <a href="Projects/Trends_in_General_Conference.pdf">Click Here</a>. The second semester, we dedicated our time to implementing various machine learning algorithms on the dataset. I experimented with different clustering and classifying algorithms.

			<h3>Language Learning Tool</h3>
			<time datetime="2020-04-15">Made: April 15, 2020</time>
			<p>Learning a new language is always challenging, but the difficulty is compounded when there aren't many speakers or resources available. This is the situation for those trying to learn a small language like Kiribati. To mitigate this issue, I built a proof of concept tool that simulates conversations with a native speaker. Using open-source software and my own voice, I built a dialogue move engine with a speech synthesizer to read the generated responses. </p>
      <p>For a video walkthrough and demonstration, <a href="https://youtu.be/kMM3zPFvYzY">Click Here</a>. The full methodology and work are recorded in <a href="Projects/kiribati_learning_tool.pdf">this paper</a>.</p>

			<h3>Minimum Edits</h3>
			<time datetime="2020-12-14">Made: December 14, 2020</time>
			<p>I was asked to create a tool that would compare two documents and return a score based on the edits required to transform the first text into the second. Also, the client wanted to see a list of each edit used. Responding to the first request, I coded up a version of the Wagner–Fischer algorithm for computing the Levenshtein Distance. This dynamic programming algorithm is efficient because it does not keep track of the specific edits, just that they happened. This script allowed me to solve the client's first problem, but not the second. Further, I couldn't find an algorithm or premade package that would efficiently keep track of each edit. I delivered the tool and apologized that I was unable to fulfill their second wish at that time. This failure bugged me for several months until I was asked to implement another algorithm for a class. The dots connected; I suddenly knew how to solve the client's problem.</p>

			<h3>Optimal Hide and Seek</h3>
			<time datetime="2020-04-9">Made: April 9, 2020</time>
			<p>We sought to find the path for a seeker to take to have a view of all hiding spots in the shortest time. We modeled the situation as a grid with a single obstacle and used differential equations and control theory to find a result. Our main method was to use Pontryagins Maximum Principle to provide simple variable definitions and then adapted a python based numerical solver. </p>

			<h3>Facial Recognition</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-11-27">Made: November 27, 2018</time>
			<p> When I made this, I was quite proud of it. Looking back, it's quite a naive implementation. I used the singular value decomposition (SVD) to compress a database of images. I converted that database into a matrix where each row represented a different image. With that matrix in place, I can now take any test image and find its match using the Euclidean metric for distance. If I were to recreate it now, I would store the images in a KD-Tree for more efficient indexing of images and use a nearest neighbor search algorithm to retrieve matches.

			<h3>Fourier Transform</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-11-29">Made: November 29, 2018</time>
			<p>The Fourier Transform is a method of decomposing a signal into its constituent frequencies. It has so many applications in any branch of signal processing that the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was named one of the top 10 algorithms of the 20th century. This notebook represents some of my preliminary experiments in implementing the different algorithms for computing the Fourier Transform. After that, I play with some of the different applications like convolutions and filtering.For a demo of the code and output, <a href="Projects/fourier_transform.html">Click Here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Kalman Filter</h3>
			<time datetime="2020-01-18">Made: January 18, 2020</time>
			<p>The Kalman Filter is an algorithm for making smooth functions out of noisy data. This algorithm has applications any time you are working with observational data with any amount of noise. For example, the Kalman Filter was used in the guidance systems for the Apollo missions to the moon back in the 1960s. The system would use the algorithm to incorporate new positional data into a working model so that the astronauts could accurately predict where on Earth (or the Moon) they would land. <a href="Projects/kalman_filter.html">Click Here</a> for a demo that displays some of my early learning and experimentation with this algorithm.</p>
