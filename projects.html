			<h3>Facial Recognition</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-11-27">Made: November 27, 2018</time>
			<p> When I made this, I was quite proud of it. Looking back, it's quite a naive implementation. I used the singular value decomposition (SVD) to compress a database of images. I converted that database into a matrix where each row represented a different image. With that matrix in place, I can now take any test image and find its match using the Euclidean metric for distance. If I were to recreate it now, I would store the images in a KD-Tree for more efficient indexing of images and use a nearest neighbor search algorithm to retrieve matches. For a demo of the code and output, <a href="Projects/facial_recognition.html">Click Here</a>.</p>

			<h3>Fourier Transform</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-11-29">Made: November 29, 2018</time>
			<p>The Fourier Transform has so many applications in any branch of signal processing. This notebook represents some of my preliminary experiments in implementing the different algorithms. Also shown are some different uses of this technology including filtering static out of the Apollo 11 transmissions.

			<h3>Battery Vision</h3>
			<time datetime="2018-12-08">Made: December 12, 2018</time>
			<p>Due to the massive volume of research literature on any given topic, extracting specific data can be work-intensive. As an effort to mitigate this, my team implemented a Word2Vec approach to indexing data in lithium-sulfur battery literature. Our implementation of Word2Vec consisted of converting each word in the training set to a vector and then embedding them in a 50-dimensional space based off their similarity. Using this method, we were able to determine which reported values were theoretical or actually observed in experiments. Our results and presentation were ranked most impressive in a class poster presentation. Since I am not the sole owner of this work, I do not have the rights to post our code or research poster.</p>

			<h3>German Speech Recognizer</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-12-16">Made: December 16, 2019</time>
			<p>In many domains, building an automatic speech recognizer has become a rather solved problem. The accuracy and quality that has been attained in English were both only achieved after many years of optimization and using large training sets. While the technology and some open-source data sets exist, few people have made acoustic models or speech recognizers in German. I sought to remedy this situation by the Kaldi recipes prepared by Cobalt Speech Inc. and the opensource CommonVoice German dataset. Even with a major mistake in the data cleaning steps, we still acheived a word error rate of 33%. This number improved drastically when the model was re-trained with properly cleaned data. Due to the nature of my collaboration with Cobalt, they own the rights to the completed model and subsequent code that I made.</p>

			<h3>Amazon S3 DeepRacer</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-11-15">Made: November 15, 2019</time>
			<p>I was invited to compete in an AWS DeepRacer competition. After a water-hose training on reinforcement learning, we were given the opportunity to use what we had learned to compete. We each coded up a cost function to ‘teach’ the car the best way around the track. Then we used the provided virtual racetrack to train our models. I was handicapped by only having half the time to train my model. However, in the real-world test situation, my car completed the track in 11 seconds placing me third overall.

			<h3>Kalman Filter</h3>
			<time datetime="2020-01-18">Made: January 18, 2020</time>
			<p>The Kalman Filter is an algorithm for making smooth functions out of noisy data. This algorithm has applications any time you are working with observational data with any amount of noise. For example, the Kalman Filter was used in the guidance systems for the Apollo missions to the moon back in the 1960s. The system would use the algorithm to incorporate new positional data into a working model so that the astronauts could accurately predict where on Earth (or the Moon) they would land.

			<h3>Statistical Forecasting</h3>
			<time datetime="2019-08-16">Made: August 16, 2019</time>
			<p>I developed a model to forecast supply and demand of core services both in the short term and 10 years into the future. Using domain knowledge and SQL, I was able to obtain and clean data sets to find solutions to new problems. Then I worked with a Bayesian Structured Time Series approach in R to predict future quantities. I built dashboards in Tableau to display different aspects of the forecast and built tools to enable users to manipulate parameters. These tools were integral to the budgeting and planning efforts of many departments.</p>
